# Avoiding merge conflicts

Follow these instructions carefully to avoid merge conflicts (for `HW0.75` and others).

1. Create a backup of you current work. You can do it by **manually copying the files locally**. This step is important so check carefully if your backup was correctly created. Do this to avoid losing your work. If you have any confusion, please contact us **before** proceeding with the next steps. 

2. Go to your repository's github, and click on `Sync Fork`

3. You should see either #option1 or #option2


**For #option1**

If you see #option1 -- it means you made a recent push to your github that is causing this conflict. Click on `Discard commit` as shown below.

**For #option2**

If you see #option2 -- it means there are no merge conflicts. Click on `Update branch`

4. Clone your repository to a **different location** (on your laptop or the server), this will likely not have the changes you had pushed/made so you need to **manually replace the files** (or the specific content from each code file) from the backup to this new clone. Make all future changes and commits from the new clone.
